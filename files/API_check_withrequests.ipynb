Robert Oppenheimer\\'\\'\\' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|p|ən|h|aɪ|m|ər}} {{respelling|OP|ən|hy|mər}}; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and director of the [[Manhattan Project]]\\'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] during [[World War II]]. He is often called the \"father of the [[atomic bomb]]\".\\n\\nBorn in New York City, Oppenheimer earned a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in chemistry from [[Harvard University]] in 1925 and a [[Dr. rer. nat.|doctorate]] in physics from the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany in 1927, where he studied under [[Max Born]]. After research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he became a full professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including achievements in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[nuclear physics]] such as the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]] for molecular [[wave function]]s, work on the theory of [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s, the [[Oppenheimer–Phillips process]] in [[nuclear fusion]], and early work on [[quantum tunneling]]. With his students, he also made contributions to the theory of [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s, [[quantum field theory]], and the interactions of [[cosmic ray]]s.\\n\\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 he was appointed director of the project\\'s [[Project Y|Los Alamos Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]], tasked with developing the first [[nuclear weapons]]. His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project\\'s success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]. In August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the [[bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.\\n\\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]]. He lobbied for international control of [[nuclear power]] to avert [[nuclear proliferation]] and a [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. He opposed the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]] during a 1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions. During the [[second Red Scare]], Oppenheimer\\'s stances, together with his past associations with the [[Communist Party USA]], led to the revocation of his [[security clearance#United States|security clearance]] following a [[Oppenheimer security hearing|1954 security hearing]]. This effectively ended his access to the government\\'s atomic secrets and thus his career as a nuclear physicist. Stripped also of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In 1963, he was awarded the [[Enrico Fermi Award]] as a gesture of [[political rehabilitation]]. He died four years later of [[throat cancer]]. In 2022, the federal government vacated the 1954 revocation of Oppenheimer\\'s security clearance.\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n=== Childhood and education ===\\nOppenheimer was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer{{hairsp}}{{refn|group=note|name=initialJ|Oppenheimer\\'s birth certificate reads \"Julius Robert Oppenheimer\",{{sfn|Cassidy|2005|p=2}}<ref>{{harvnb|Pais|2006|p=355 (end plates)}}</ref> his college transcript \"J Robert Oppenheimer\".{{sfn|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=337}} Oppenheimer himself said the \\'\\'J\\'\\' stood for nothing, and his brother Frank \"surmised that the \\'\\'J\\'\\' was symbolic, a gesture in the direction of naming the eldest son after the father but at the same time a signal that his parents did not want Robert to be a \\'junior.{{\\' \"}}<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=1}}</ref>}} into a [[Jewish secularism|non-observant Jewish]] family in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful textile importer.<ref>{{harvnb|Schweber|2008|p=283}}</ref><ref name=\"Cassidy, pp. 5-11\">{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=5–11}}</ref> Robert had a younger brother, [[Frank Oppenheimer|Frank]], who also became a physicist.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=16, 145, 282}}</ref> Their father was born in [[Hanau]], then part of the [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and came to the United States as a teenager in 1888 with few resources and no money, baccalaureate studies, or knowledge of the English language.

To compensate for the delay caused by his illness, he took six courses each term instead of the usual four. He was admitted to the undergraduate honor society [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and was granted graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he could bypass basic courses in favor of advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on [[thermodynamics]] taught by [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Percy Bridgman]]. In 1925, after only three years, Oppenheimer graduated from Harvard with a [[Bachelor of Arts]], \\'\\'[[summa cum laude]]\\'\\'.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=75–76, 88–89}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Studies in Europe ===\\n[[File:Leiden Kamerlingh-Onnes Lab.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]]\\' Laboratory in [[Leiden]], Netherlands, July 1927.

According to Oppenheimer\\'s friend [[Francis Fergusson]], Oppenheimer once confessed to leaving an apple doused with poison on Blackett\\'s desk; no one ate it. Oppenheimer\\'s parents convinced the university authorities not to press criminal charges or expel him.

Roosevelt]] approved a crash program to develop an [[atomic bomb]]. Lawrence brought Oppenheimer into the project on October 21. On May 18, 1942, {{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=44–46}} [[National Defense Research Committee]] Chairman [[James B. Conant]], who had been one of Oppenheimer\\'s lecturers at Harvard, asked Oppenheimer to take over work on [[fast neutron]] calculations, a task Oppenheimer threw himself into with full vigor. He was given the title \"Coordinator of Rapid Rupture\", which specifically referred to the propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to host a summer school for bomb theory in Berkeley. The mix of European physicists and his own students—a group including Robert Serber, [[Emil Konopinski]], [[Felix Bloch]], Hans Bethe and Edward Teller—kept themselves busy by calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make the bomb.{{sfn|Norris|2002|p=240}}{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42–44}}\\n\\n[[File:Oppenheimer-j r.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Oppenheimer\\'s ID photo from the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]|alt=Mug shot with \"K-6\" over it.]]\\nIn June 1942, the [[U.S. Army]] established the [[Manhattan Engineer District]] to handle its part in the atom bomb project, beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] to the military.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=72–74}}</ref> In September, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R.

Groves worried that because Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize, he might not have had the prestige to direct fellow scientists,{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=61–63}} but Groves was impressed by Oppenheimer\\'s singular grasp of the practical aspects of the project and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a [[military engineer]], Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics but also chemistry, [[metallurgy]], [[explosive weapon|ordnance]], and [[engineering]]. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an \"overweening ambition\",{{sfn|Norris|2002|p=242}} which Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion.{{sfn|Norris|2002|p=242}} Oppenheimer\\'s past associations were not overlooked, but on July 20, 1943, Groves directed that he receive a security clearance \"<!--In accordance with my verbal directions of July 15, it is desired that clearance be issued to Julius Robert Oppenheimer -->without delay irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr Oppenheimer.

On November 16, 1942, he, Groves and others toured a prospective site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding it would feel claustrophobic, and there was concern about possible flooding. He then suggested a site he knew well: a flat [[mesa]] near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], which was the site of a private boys\\' school, the [[Los Alamos Ranch School]]. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road and the water supply but otherwise felt that it was ideal.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=66–67}} The [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] was built on the site of the school, taking over some of its buildings, while many new buildings were erected in great haste.

He was noted for his mastery of all scientific aspects of the project and for his efforts to control the inevitable cultural conflicts between scientists and the military. [[Victor Weisskopf]] wrote:\\n\\n{{quote|Oppenheimer directed these studies, theoretical and experimental, in the real sense of the words.

When Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] in April 1944, a problem was discovered: reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of [[plutonium-240]], making it unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=226–229}}</ref>\\n\\nIn July 1944, Oppenheimer abandoned the gun design in favor of an [[Nuclear weapon design|implosion-type]] weapon.

He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including [[Freeman Dyson]], and the duo of [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Tsung-Dao Lee]], who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of [[Parity (physics)|parity]] non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[George F. Kennan]]. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research.

Under Oppenheimer\\'s direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problem of the pre-war years: infinite, divergent, and seemingly nonsensical expressions in the quantum electrodynamics of [[elementary particle]]s. [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Shin\\'ichiro Tomonaga]] tackled the problem of [[Regularization (physics)|regularization]], and developed techniques that became known as [[renormalization]]. Freeman Dyson was able to prove that their procedures gave similar results. The problem of meson absorption and [[Hideki Yukawa]]\\'s theory of mesons as the carrier particles of the [[strong nuclear force]] were also tackled. Probing questions from Oppenheimer prompted [[Robert Marshak]]\\'s innovative two-meson [[hypothesis]]: that there are actually two types of mesons, [[pion]]s and [[muon]]s.

In this report, the committee advocated the creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. [[Bernard Baruch]] was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the [[Baruch Plan]] of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union\\'s uranium resources. It was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States\\' nuclear monopoly and rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union,<ref>{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=347–349}}</ref> which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.<ref>{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=353}}</ref>\\n\\nAfter the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) came into being in 1947 as a civilian agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC).

Robert Oppenheimer\\'\\'\\' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|p|ən|h|aɪ|m|ər}} {{respelling|OP|ən|hy|mər}}; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and director of the [[Manhattan Project]]\\'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] during [[World War II]]. He is often called the \"father of the [[atomic bomb]]\".\\n\\nBorn in New York City, Oppenheimer earned a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in chemistry from [[Harvard University]] in 1925 and a [[Dr. rer. nat.|doctorate]] in physics from the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany in 1927, where he studied under [[Max Born]]. After research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he became a full professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including achievements in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[nuclear physics]] such as the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]] for molecular [[wave function]]s, work on the theory of [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s, the [[Oppenheimer–Phillips process]] in [[nuclear fusion]], and early work on [[quantum tunneling]]. With his students, he also made contributions to the theory of [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s, [[quantum field theory]], and the interactions of [[cosmic ray]]s.\\n\\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 he was appointed director of the project\\'s [[Project Y|Los Alamos Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]], tasked with developing the first [[nuclear weapons]]. His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project\\'s success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]. In August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the [[bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.\\n\\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]]. He lobbied for international control of [[nuclear power]] to avert [[nuclear proliferation]] and a [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. He opposed the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]] during a 1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions. During the [[second Red Scare]], Oppenheimer\\'s stances, together with his past associations with the [[Communist Party USA]], led to the revocation of his [[security clearance#United States|security clearance]] following a [[Oppenheimer security hearing|1954 security hearing]]. This effectively ended his access to the government\\'s atomic secrets and thus his career as a nuclear physicist. Stripped also of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In 1963, he was awarded the [[Enrico Fermi Award]] as a gesture of [[political rehabilitation]]. He died four years later of [[throat cancer]]. In 2022, the federal government vacated the 1954 revocation of Oppenheimer\\'s security clearance.\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n=== Childhood and education ===\\nOppenheimer was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer{{hairsp}}{{refn|group=note|name=initialJ|Oppenheimer\\'s birth certificate reads \"Julius Robert Oppenheimer\",{{sfn|Cassidy|2005|p=2}}<ref>{{harvnb|Pais|2006|p=355 (end plates)}}</ref> his college transcript \"J Robert Oppenheimer\".{{sfn|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=337}} Oppenheimer himself said the \\'\\'J\\'\\' stood for nothing, and his brother Frank \"surmised that the \\'\\'J\\'\\' was symbolic, a gesture in the direction of naming the eldest son after the father but at the same time a signal that his parents did not want Robert to be a \\'junior.{{\\' \"}}<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=1}}</ref>}} into a [[Jewish secularism|non-observant Jewish]] family in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful textile importer.<ref>{{harvnb|Schweber|2008|p=283}}</ref><ref name=\"Cassidy, pp. 5-11\">{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=5–11}}</ref> Robert had a younger brother, [[Frank Oppenheimer|Frank]], who also became a physicist.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=16, 145, 282}}</ref> Their father was born in [[Hanau]], then part of the [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and came to the United States as a teenager in 1888 with few resources and no money, baccalaureate studies, or knowledge of the English language.

Roosevelt]] approved a crash program to develop an [[atomic bomb]]. Lawrence brought Oppenheimer into the project on October 21. On May 18, 1942, {{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=44–46}} [[National Defense Research Committee]] Chairman [[James B. Conant]], who had been one of Oppenheimer\\'s lecturers at Harvard, asked Oppenheimer to take over work on [[fast neutron]] calculations, a task Oppenheimer threw himself into with full vigor. He was given the title \"Coordinator of Rapid Rupture\", which specifically referred to the propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to host a summer school for bomb theory in Berkeley. The mix of European physicists and his own students—a group including Robert Serber, [[Emil Konopinski]], [[Felix Bloch]], Hans Bethe and Edward Teller—kept themselves busy by calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make the bomb.{{sfn|Norris|2002|p=240}}{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42–44}}\\n\\n[[File:Oppenheimer-j r.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Oppenheimer\\'s ID photo from the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]|alt=Mug shot with \"K-6\" over it.]]\\nIn June 1942, the [[U.S. Army]] established the [[Manhattan Engineer District]] to handle its part in the atom bomb project, beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] to the military.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=72–74}}</ref> In September, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R.

Groves worried that because Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize, he might not have had the prestige to direct fellow scientists,{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=61–63}} but Groves was impressed by Oppenheimer\\'s singular grasp of the practical aspects of the project and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a [[military engineer]], Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics but also chemistry, [[metallurgy]], [[explosive weapon|ordnance]], and [[engineering]]. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an \"overweening ambition\",{{sfn|Norris|2002|p=242}} which Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion.{{sfn|Norris|2002|p=242}} Oppenheimer\\'s past associations were not overlooked, but on July 20, 1943, Groves directed that he receive a security clearance \"<!--In accordance with my verbal directions of July 15, it is desired that clearance be issued to Julius Robert Oppenheimer -->without delay irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr Oppenheimer.

On November 16, 1942, he, Groves and others toured a prospective site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding it would feel claustrophobic, and there was concern about possible flooding. He then suggested a site he knew well: a flat [[mesa]] near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], which was the site of a private boys\\' school, the [[Los Alamos Ranch School]]. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road and the water supply but otherwise felt that it was ideal.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=66–67}} The [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] was built on the site of the school, taking over some of its buildings, while many new buildings were erected in great haste. At the laboratory, Oppenheimer assembled a group of the top physicists of the time, whom he called the \"luminaries\".{{sfn|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=227}}\\n\\nLos Alamos was initially supposed to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army.

He was noted for his mastery of all scientific aspects of the project and for his efforts to control the inevitable cultural conflicts between scientists and the military. [[Victor Weisskopf]] wrote:\\n\\n{{quote|Oppenheimer directed these studies, theoretical and experimental, in the real sense of the words.

He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[George F. Kennan]].

In this report, the committee advocated the creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. [[Bernard Baruch]] was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the [[Baruch Plan]] of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union\\'s uranium resources. It was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States\\' nuclear monopoly and rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union,<ref>{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=347–349}}</ref> which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.<ref>{{harvnb|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=353}}</ref>\\n\\nAfter the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) came into being in 1947 as a civilian agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC).

The other group thought developing the H-bomb would not improve Western security and that [[Nuclear holocaust|using the weapon against large civilian populations]] would be [[genocide]]; they advocated instead a more flexible response to the Soviets involving tactical nuclear weapons, strengthened conventional forces, and arms control agreements.

In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother.

Robert Oppenheimer\\'\\'\\' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|p|ən|h|aɪ|m|ər}} {{respelling|OP|ən|hy|mər}}; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and director of the [[Manhattan Project]]\\'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] during [[World War II]]. He is often called the \"father of the [[atomic bomb]]\".\\n\\nBorn in New York City, Oppenheimer earned a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in chemistry from [[Harvard University]] in 1925 and a [[Dr. rer. nat.|doctorate]] in physics from the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany in 1927, where he studied under [[Max Born]]. After research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he became a full professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including achievements in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[nuclear physics]] such as the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]] for molecular [[wave function]]s, work on the theory of [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s, the [[Oppenheimer–Phillips process]] in [[nuclear fusion]], and early work on [[quantum tunneling]]. With his students, he also made contributions to the theory of [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s, [[quantum field theory]], and the interactions of [[cosmic ray]]s.\\n\\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 he was appointed director of the project\\'s [[Project Y|Los Alamos Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]], tasked with developing the first [[nuclear weapons]]. His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project\\'s success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]. In August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the [[bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.\\n\\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]]. He lobbied for international control of [[nuclear power]] to avert [[nuclear proliferation]] and a [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. He opposed the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]] during a 1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions. During the [[second Red Scare]], Oppenheimer\\'s stances, together with his past associations with the [[Communist Party USA]], led to the revocation of his [[security clearance#United States|security clearance]] following a [[Oppenheimer security hearing|1954 security hearing]]. This effectively ended his access to the government\\'s atomic secrets and thus his career as a nuclear physicist. Stripped also of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In 1963, he was awarded the [[Enrico Fermi Award]] as a gesture of [[political rehabilitation]]. He died four years later of [[throat cancer]]. In 2022, the federal government vacated the 1954 revocation of Oppenheimer\\'s security clearance.\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n=== Childhood and education ===\\nOppenheimer was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer{{hairsp}}{{refn|group=note|name=initialJ|Oppenheimer\\'s birth certificate reads \"Julius Robert Oppenheimer\",{{sfn|Cassidy|2005|p=2}}<ref>{{harvnb|Pais|2006|p=355 (end plates)}}</ref> his college transcript \"J Robert Oppenheimer\".{{sfn|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=337}} Oppenheimer himself said the \\'\\'J\\'\\' stood for nothing, and his brother Frank \"surmised that the \\'\\'J\\'\\' was symbolic, a gesture in the direction of naming the eldest son after the father but at the same time a signal that his parents did not want Robert to be a \\'junior.{{\\' \"}}<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=1}}</ref>}} into a [[Jewish secularism|non-observant Jewish]] family in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful textile importer.<ref>{{harvnb|Schweber|2008|p=283}}</ref><ref name=\"Cassidy, pp. 5-11\">{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=5–11}}</ref> Robert had a younger brother, [[Frank Oppenheimer|Frank]], who also became a physicist.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassidy|2005|pp=16, 145, 282}}</ref> Their father was born in [[Hanau]], then part of the [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and came to the United States as a teenager in 1888 with few resources and no money, baccalaureate studies, or knowledge of the English language.

He was admitted to the undergraduate honor society [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and was granted graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he could bypass basic courses in favor of advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on [[thermodynamics]] taught by [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Percy Bridgman]].

One of his first acts was to host a summer school for bomb theory in Berkeley.

The other group thought developing the H-bomb would not improve Western security and that [[Nuclear holocaust|using the weapon against large civilian populations]] would be [[genocide]]; they advocated instead a more flexible response to the Soviets involving tactical nuclear weapons, strengthened conventional forces, and arms control agreements.

In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother.
